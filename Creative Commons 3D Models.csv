Of course, I just noticed that someone already designed a similar part, and it look really nice (if not better), [check it out here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4235024) !

*\*\*\*edit 02/07/2020 (non-retarded date format)\*\*\*
added a left and right version so you don't have to go through the tedious process of copying and flipping ;)*

#what it is
Just two ""hinges"" to replace broken ones of makita MAKPAC top cover. I didn't try on festool systainer, it may work (please let me know)...

#how to print it
The orientation toward the printing bed (bigger face towards bed) should be already set (tested in cura).

Concerning the filling and stuff you shouldn't be too worried about the strength because of the forces orientation. I used 20% with 2 lines walls and its plenty enough.

#how to use it
**look at the uploaded photos**
- carefully remove the original pins form the inside out
- After printing, you can put a bit of glue inside the top cover hole thingy (might be unnecessary due to force fit), then push the printed hinges inside and hammer then gently all the way down.
*Note : don't mistake the left and right hinge tho cause they can be hard to remove*
- put back the original pins

-------------

I designed this part after wind slammed and broke the top cover of my makita MAKPAC storage box.

I noticed the original hinge were pretty weak but seemed be easily replaceable, so i did.

I have my own DIY 3D Scanner, based on Modified Version of FlexScan3D,  and one of its advantages is that it has a flat calibration panel, that allows the user to have a precise calibration and reach incredible accuracy on the scans. 

You can 3D print this stand with PLA or PETG or any other material. 
it is better to use higher infill percentage, to make sure that your stand has enough strength.  Calibration panels are so sensitive. take care about them.

With its bright yellow color and bold black lettering, the ""Warning: Nothing to See Here"" sign is the perfect addition to any toy construction site, playroom, or office desk. But unlike other caution signs that warn of real dangers, this one is completely harmless (and useless).

Place it next to your child's toy bulldozer and watch as they pretend to dig up imaginary dirt while completely ignoring the sign. Or put it on your desk to warn coworkers of absolutely nothing. The possibilities are endless!

And don't worry, the ""Warning: Nothing to See Here"" sign is made from high-quality 3D printed plastic, so it's completely safe for kids (and adults) to handle. You can even use it as a makeshift frisbee or coaster (although we don't recommend it).

So if you're looking for a toy caution sign that's sure to bring a smile to your face (but doesn't actually do anything), look no further than the ""Warning: Nothing to See Here"" 3D printed caution sign. It's the perfect addition to any collection of pointless toys!","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/2d/db/56/dc/c5/0c398d56-9086-410b-9894-dfaa275e640e.png""]","{""name"":""aly***158***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/alynch1580""}","[""danger"",""sign"",""warning"",""warning sign""]","2023-03-19T17:47:12.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/5919904/files",0,3,1,

Any existing material residue causes the bed to be pressed down during the offset measurement, resulting in a higher measured distance. This, in turn, positions the nozzle too close to the bed. The severity of this effect is influenced by the hardness and quantity of the residue.

Since I don't want to forgo automated bed leveling (KAMP) before each print, I've devised an approach for an automated cleaning system.

All you need is a brush, the macro, and an adjustment in your Start-Print-Macro. Additionally, I've created a No-Go-Area (Polygon) for the Orca Slicer to avoid its usage.

I sourced the brush from Amazon (https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CHNZ458F) and cut the brush head after 40mm from the handle. You can also use any reasonably fitting alternative brush. The parameterized Fusion360 model, a Step file, and the STL file are provided.

Installation:
Print the holder in a heat-resistant material (ABS, ASA, ...). Insert the brush into the holder. Attach the holder to the front left corner of the print bed. Copy the macro (macro.cfg) into your printer.cfg.

Add the following line to your Start-Macro after heating the bed and before bed leveling: CLEAN_NOZZLE EXTRUDER_TEMP={params.EXTRUDER_TEMP|default(200)|float} WIPES={10}. (Parameter WIPES: Number of cleaning movements (default = 10). Cleaning temperature = Extrusion temperature - 40°C.)

Optional: Add the following polygon under Printer Settings -> Excluded Print Bed Area in the Orca Slicer: 0x0,25x0,25x5,5x5,5x42,0x42.

Your N4P should now clean its nozzle before each bed leveling and hopefully deliver a correct Z-offset afterward.

Seed storage 1248 card size.","This is a Bitcoin wallet designed to store up to 24 words, each generated according to the BIP39 standard. You can find the index of each word in the official Bitcoin repository on GitHub. The link is also provided in the description. This wallet is perfect for airport travel, and because it is made with 3D printing, it won't be detected by metal detectors. It's easy to carry in your wallet as it has the same size as a credit card. The holes should be made with a nail or some kind of piercing metal tool; a hammer can be used, but any heavy object that won’t break will work.

Professor Renato Amoedo, @r38tao, discussed the potential downsides of metal wallets in certain scenarios on a podcast, which inspired me to create this plastic seed storage. He is the author of Bitcoin Redpill, co-written with Professor Allan Schruam—both of whom are knowledgeable and good people.

In online forums, some have raised concerns about the plastic not being fireproof. However, the purpose of these cards is to add an extra layer of encryption, protecting bitcoiners from individuals who fully understand what 12/24 words mean.

Stack sats—and more importantly, protect them from those who want them by force. (Matthew 25:29)

I found one of these on Amazon that was nice and all metal, but it didn't fit! This one fits a drain pipe with an inside diameter of 27mm (1 inch). The little tabs on the side are meant to fit the little drain holes that exist near the top of my drain pipe, but if those little holes don't fit it may friction fit in your drain anyway. 

I printed this ON ITS SIDE, because printing it standing on end will make it too easy to break the little tabs that hold it in place. This is a work in progress. If I have any more revisions of it, I'll be sure to upload them.

I have modified the extractor to support a flange that is fixed to the motor shaft, where I believe it will prevent wear, and with 4 x 50mm bolts.

At the bottom of the extractor I placed 4 inserts where the screws are fixed.

For those who, like me, suffer from this problem, I think it's a valid attempt that solves it, without the need to print other parts, reusing what we already have and while we wait for the new version of Petamentor 3.

What you will need, in addition to printing the STL:
1x 6mm Flange
4x M3 x 50mm screws
4x M3 x 4mm inserts or 4x M3 nuts

You can weld the insert to the bottom of the puller, or use the nuts. In my case I put both to make it stronger and give a finish.","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/d1/b8/64/ec/ce/b5d0292e-2daa-4890-b4a9-043581061724.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/66/56/b7/92/24/77274b76-85e9-4d57-b929-e01242fdcea2.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/77/13/74/85/54/82dac6d4-ab7e-413b-8055-0439183ffd06.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/e1/15/e8/4d/bb/e656f660-9529-4bef-8ff5-fa7a18222e61.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/95/87/77/f0/2a/66c8b376-fa62-4eef-b522-e1136230b34d.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/b2/42/a5/f5/45/db8d3b79-17d5-42d0-8e92-fd98f40eec02.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/53/e2/1c/22/2d/d3ff15f7-40d3-4a68-82c9-fb58f86d2558.png""]","{""name"":""nel***-sa***s"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/nelson-santos""}",[],"2023-05-31T18:13:54.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6055066/files",2,11,1,"Printer brand: Creality Printer: Ender 3 Supports: Yes Resolution: 0.3 Infill: 50%"
"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6058957","6058957","https://www.thingiverse.com/","Faking Filament Color","Filament is not 100% opaque, it still maintains a reasonable transparency. This allows us to fake a filament color by printing a few layers of one color on top of another color. For example, if you print a few layers of blue on top of multiple white layers, the result will look like light blue. And if you print that same blue on top of black, the result will look like dark blue.

You are not limited to make colors lighter or darker, you can mix any two colors. For example, I printed yellow on top of red and I was getting orange (see photo). Obviously, it will take some experimenting before you know how many layers to print. That is where this tool comes in handy. It will show you the result colors for 0-10 layers (on top of the base color). The tool is 2mm thick, bottom 1mm is the base color, top 1mm is the prime color.

The tool has been designed to be printed at 0.1mm. You do have to set it up properly in your slicer. The tool is 2mm thick, so we want a color change (filament change) right before it starts printing the layer at 1.1mm. This is done in your slicer, if you have never done this, please read up on it.

Pointing out the obvious: faking a filament color will only work for flat surfaces. But in most cases, this is sufficient.

I also closed the eyes of the head (model found on the Smartdoll website) because I wanted to do a sleeping head for my elf girl (hence the slight droop of the ears). The model is definitely not perfect but after a fair amount of sanding, it works well for my uses at least.
Go forth and have fun with this model, remix it as you please and feel free to post what you make!

Printing: I printed mine on a filament printer with a 0.07 layer height with support for the ears as well as on the inside of the head.

UPDATE:
After learning a lot about 3D modelling, I went back and cleaned up the model a bit, making it a lot less polygon-y, so if you&#039;re printing one, use the new version!

"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6042754","6042754","https://www.thingiverse.com/","Constellations Tactile Image","Part of a wider collection of tactile images for blind and partially sighted people, these 3D printed constellations are designed to be understood through touch, with a laser cut board functioning as a template to show the formations relation to one another in the night sky.  

Created in partial fulfilment of the requirements of a PhD at the University of Huddersfield, the thesis includes resources and information to aid in the design and creation of tactile images from both a professional and engaged amateur audience.  

“Constellations lend themselves well to my already established form of tactile translation, circles and lines are simple to replicate and such models apply many of the same principles of raised line drawing that we utilise in other works, albeit in a less complex or pattern centric way. Even these rudimentary depictions can be used to explain formation, proximity and relation to other constellations, offering translations of broadly accessible information that does not necessarily have obvious application. Indeed, whilst wayfinding is one of the primary reasons to know of constellations and to be able to recognise them in relation to one another, it is not a skill that most of us apply on a regular basis. Many of us may know of Orion by virtue of having looked up at the sky, noting such celestial landmarks as Cassiopeia or the North star not as tools for survival, but as a connection to our collective histories and the shared stories that surround them. 

Blind people may know the existence and names of these formations, they might also be familiar with the heroes and legends that birthed them, but a tangible visual understanding of a constellation is not something easily conveyed through description alone. To say Orion bears a striking resemblance to a human figure, or that either of the two Ursa formations are clear depictions of bears, is perhaps overstating their similarities to their name sakes. A degree of imaginative vision is required to understand these forms within the contexts of their mythos, and within that context it is not unreasonable to expect these depictions to be available to those without sight. Indeed, this can be thought of as both offering access to imagery contained within a shared visual lexicon, and as a way of providing a tactile approximation of an already abstracted form” (Crumlish, 2023)

This is a modified design of the previous Iris Dome Box. You can see the previous one here: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/6-leaf-iris-dome-box-4e3ca5bcfabf4962b810f5a693b1b0e2

and here:https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6133298

Some folks test-printed the previous design and gave me feedback so, I had the design modified according to the feedback I received and came up with the version you can find in this post. Hope this design does not require further modifications.

Notice_1: 3D print all the files provided here and then assemble the parts so, you get the 6-leaf Iris Dome Box. 

Notice_2: you will need to 3D print “leaf_07292023.stl” six times. (you are going to need 6 leaves if you want this thing to work) 

Notice_3: assembling the leaves is the most challenging part of the assembly process so, don’t give up on it soon.

History:

this is a 6-leaf Iris dome box and I believe it could be the 3rd or 4th original design of a similar type Iris dome box category.

You might know Emmette Lalish who I believe has made the first Iris Dome Box of 5 leaves (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1811143)

Then Jeff Kerr remixed Emmett's design and made his own unique Iris Dome Box of 4 leaves. (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1817180)

finally, there is Brien Allison who has made a 7-leaf Iris Dome Box. (https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-orbox-192727)

====================

This is a work in progress
---------------------

I've recently started modeling a lot of simple trays. Most of these trays can be scaled up and down to fit your needs or your printer's bed size. 

I so far have:
- A set of simple countertop trays
- A set of stackable containers for creators and makers
- I am working on more maker-friendly racks and trays

I started a project to make 28mm miniatures that would print without supports quickly. These minis print flat in 2 pieces and then I glue them together with a little bit of super glue. Now I can make custom minis that print quickly on FDM, don't need paint, and are friendly with wet erase. Hopefully they can be of use to you as well.

It is not very pretty but works well just by slipping it onto the barrel assembly.

The hardest part was getting the Nerf gun apart as they are really well made and unfortuntely clipped as opposed to screwed together but after persisting with a sharp knife was able to gain access and take out the laser assembly (not actually a laser, just red LED that is focused thru a lens.  Enough of the clips of the Nerf remained to enable me to put it back together as a working Nerf gun after the operation.

Instead of printing a battery compartment I just used the one from the Nerf and trimmed the excess plastic off it so that it sits nicely in the enclosure.

Anyways - have fun :-)  The box part was printed with supports as it has some structure to position the circuit board. Also the barrel end has a slanted face on it to match the tilt of the lens to achieve correct sighting at 3' so that it printed nice and flat on the bed ;-)","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/16/3a/3d/a4/dd/829482e4-53ef-4757-b380-aab78a60f3a9.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/f6/1a/a7/2f/49/70236009-453a-46de-a0ae-49d70134b2ef.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/df/f6/a7/07/b5/0543a4fc-51eb-408f-a345-934b31e32454.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/1a/8f/58/39/8e/c7182a99-35c1-42ee-8fc9-d533fbbd9bd9.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/49/92/bb/ed/f5/81a325e6-2781-4e6c-946e-b0d2927ae7b2.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/a6/e9/34/2c/86/33811ada-fd31-4143-9e5f-8a3a8268db50.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/84/a6/cb/73/9f/aec7d899-93a8-4061-a626-87c4ead948a3.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/64/1d/b4/6a/ea/12677f1d-af15-40be-a958-70ee7235376d.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/af/77/14/54/49/f847c556-8a56-4dee-8fa6-90d8ffeb6773.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/76/40/28/12/b4/8c854e3e-3acc-420f-a50b-8fc198b1c156.jpg""]","{""name"":""ros***_pb***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/rossco_pb""}",[],"2023-03-24T02:38:55.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/5928313/files",0,1,3,

I thought I would upload it here now that I'm done with it in case anyone else would be interested in such a thing. It only has the basics of the class tool kit but I thought it would be more handy than pulling up my phone every turn of combat. This is my first time in a couple of years at using Fusion so a few things might be off. I hope someone else can get some use from this.

Edit:
- I made the size bigger so the text would print off better and there is more room for more features
- I added an extra slider for Hp as soon enough my character is going to be going over 100
- I added a channel divinity slot as I somehow forgot about it with the first design

They were designed to eliminate the need to lift your board to tuck the item, meteorite and quest carts as the tray has slots for each of the cards (unsleeved).  There are two print options - depending on your preference and/or your build plate size.  

Option 1 - two piece print (for large build plates)

Use the two files labeled:
- 2 Trays - Main Tray
- 2 or 4 Trays - Items Tray

Option 2 - four piece print

Use the four files labeled:
- 4 Trays - Main Tray
- 4 Trays - Quest Tray
- 4 Trays - Meteorite Tray
- 2 or 4 Trays - Items tray

The Items tray is the same for both version and will print vertically (on it's narrow side).  The main tray has two notches that will insert into the items tray to hold it in place during game play.

The main trays, quest tray and meteorite tray all print horizontally.  All prints do NOT need supports and come off the printer ready to use.

Nachdem ihr alles ausgedruckt habt, könnt ihr euch schon mit dem Zusammenbau beschäftigen. Die Motorwelle habe ich mit einem Feuerzeug warm gemacht und dann in die Schaufelradwelle gesteckt und zusätzlich mit einer Schraube gesichert. Den Motor und den Motorflansch hab ich dann einfach mit Schrauben zusammen geschraubt, der Rest besteht aus Steckverbindungen. Wie alles zusammen gebaut wird seht ihr ja auf den Bildern. Als Stromquelle könnt ihr einen ganz normalen Bohrmaschinenakku verwenden oder eben eine 12V Batterie, je nach dem was ihr grade zur Hand habt. Geht übrigens auch mit einem 18V Akku ;-)

Der Trichter ist so groß, dass ein 150er Abwasserrohr rein passt, also genug Futtervorrat für einen Urlaub.","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/c6/1d/ef/d1/35/2bc30c6d-4613-498b-83ae-71de43df96e0.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/5f/c5/fc/37/c3/40cd53bb-80fa-4f96-9471-334e32351f84.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/0a/8b/20/cd/83/2189b53b-66e9-4bb0-ae5c-68caaf237e67.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/1c/37/12/70/42/2c8e2bbd-090c-427f-9d1c-c44e2493c1f5.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/bc/2d/f1/87/ef/d5ea0739-f437-49da-ac98-33c1f9bfe050.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/06/db/1e/be/72/b95723cc-902a-482f-b774-c06da91074f2.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/30/69/e9/b3/03/50ebe59e-812a-420d-b202-fb485c8c849e.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/81/2f/94/76/36/f160371c-4245-4011-978a-4cdb55875dfb.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/51/10/15/80/b7/7632f2ef-2d8d-4f8d-b2f7-90fc67a1fd0a.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/3a/f9/09/46/6a/11e188b4-608a-4985-8ec6-48436f0b0366.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/81/af/cb/38/c3/2ea93bac-26a3-4cfd-b39f-333aeb1e26bd.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/94/da/f6/bb/c5/bf4ed62a-ccb1-4dec-a6a8-d1c7248833a1.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/30/bb/4c/6e/06/91b50e94-5c86-4cd2-ac05-0abfff5dc18d.png""]","{""name"":""flo***mei***r"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/flodermeister""}","[""futterautomat""]","2023-05-27T18:33:22.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6048374/files",0,2,9,

There are some serious issues with the models from a printing standpoint, so if you decide to use the asset library on your own and start printing, just be sure you know what you're doing.

Otherwise, I'll be uploading more TF2 weapon models as I go on. Be sure to request more TF2 models you'd want to see me optimize & release :)

You can combine them because sizes of designs are similar.
In addition, you have a chance to mount your case using mount holes placed on the left side.

I also created the mount for V-slot profile.
But be careful with demensions, likely that you need to slightly adjust the part size for a couple of percents.
In my case, I printed mount with 1 perimert, 100 percent infill and maximum cooling - in this situation installation was very stiff.","Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/80/bb/4d/46/ef/Screenshot_2024-12-11_215506.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/96/fe/b6/de/bb/CaseTop.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/5e/9e/22/62/a9/CaseBottomVent.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/8f/e0/3f/38/d5/CaseTopVent.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/48/54/47/e7/91/CaseBottom.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/7b/f1/e0/1d/0a/CaseVSlotMount.png""]","{""name"":""Po_***kin***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/Po_temkin""}","[""orange pi zero 3""]","2024-12-11T20:13:43.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6867801/files",0,0,5,"Printer brand: Creality Printer: Ender 3 Pro Rafts: No Supports: Yes Resolution: 0.4 Infill: 100"

This holder not only keeps a single crayon on top but also features removable side covers, revealing space for an additional nine crayons inside.

The back of the holder can be customized with a name or any other text. 
The uploaded model is plain, but feel free to modify it as you like. 
I created the design in Shapr3D, sliced it with Cura, and printed it using a Creality CR-6 SE.

Printing Tips:

-If you’re adding text that protrudes from the back, I found support blockers for text sticking out only 0.05"" were necessary as they caused issues.
-Ensure you add supports for the side cover pin unless you're printing it flat. (I was using dual color filament so I had to print mine vertically with support to maintain consistency in the piece) 
-With 10% infill, the final print turned out great—sturdy and visually appealing.

In this project, I combined advanced tech with a personal touch by redesigning a SmartTag2 tracker to fit into a 3D-printed sea turtle. From reverse-engineering its internal components to shrinking the design while keeping all the functionality, this custom creation is both adorable and practical. Learn how I integrated the tracker, made it smaller than the original, and added a unique twist to this everyday gadget.

The nathanstenzel remix separated the owl's head from the body and created a small storage space inside a 6-inch owl. My remix involved: (a) scaling the model about 170% to create a 10-inch model with a neck wide-enough to accommodate a small servo, (b) adding two small vertical posts on top of the body to keep the servo-holder in a fixed position, (c) hollowing the eyes (for RGB LEDs), and (d) adding a hole on the owl's back side for connecting wires from the servo, motion sensor, and LEDs (mounted inside the owl) to a microcontroller (located outside the owl). With electronics added, the end result is an owl whose head will swivel to either side while its eyes flash red and orange (or any other color) whenever someone triggers the ""radar"" motion sensor mounted inside the owl.

Standard PLA print with 1.75 mm strand and 0.2 mm settings (0.4 mm nozzle). PETG printing is no good idea, since the very fine stringing is difficult to remove, and one does not want to eat some plastic with the cookies.

Based on the only known surviving Kerr Stuart diesel loco which is at the Ffestiniog Railway under going restoration. 

The exhaust on this loco seemes to have gone through several versions, so there's 3 bodies for you to play with.

Print the body, cab roof and radiator right way up but the chassis upside down.
After painting the cab glue the radiator to the front inside the cab, ensuring it is just of center to the right,
then add the roof and 1 shutter on each side

As yet unprinted,  I don't have a motor chassis for this but have based it on the Triang Hornby 0-6-0 one.

If you print this please post your model.

====================

Main Information
---------------------

This is a gimbals mount made for the XianFei / Walksnail gimbals from the link below as well as the DJI O3 Air Unit:

https://www.allxianfei.com/en/h-pd-138.html

The part can be printed in one piece, however, I have split the spacer ring from the main part because this way the main part is fully supported on the bed and is not simply left to be supported by a massive support pad, which will end up being difficult to remove. The same has been done for the front of the nose, which has been split from the main part so that you don't need to print any supports or have any large bridges/overhangs. The small front piece can simply be glued in place after printing with some CA glue.

The part is also designed to allow the O3 Air Unit to be mounted vertically with the original DJI O3 antenna, so that you get the most out of the antenna by having it stick up as much as possible. Simply push the O3 into the opening, it's a friction fit, so ti will be held in place without issues. USB and MicroSD Card slot are still accessible, and you can add a 90degree USBC extension cable such as the one from the link below:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005560341615.html (Option: COUP-FM & 15cm length)


Recommended Parts for Printing:
---------------------

I recommend printing the following two parts:

1. T2 Gimbals Nose for O3 - Main Part Split.stl
2. T2 Gimbals Nose for O3 - Ring Part.stl

But you can choose to print whichever part you like.


Recommended Print Settings:
---------------------

I would recommend that you apply the following parameters in your slicer:

1. Two laters for vertical shells
2. Two layers for horizontal top and bottom shells
3. 10-20% infill to make sure the part is strong
4. Can be printed from PLA or LW-PLA

I've found that they're a little top heavy and tend to topple or just get bumped around my shelves. So I designed a rack to hold 9 sensors together. The carbon dioxide sensors do not have to be stored upright, but it is convenient to store them the same way. I used the printer test to make sure that the bottle fit inside the square and to test the depth of the label. The final 3x3 model is taller and the fit is a little snug, but not enough for me to redesign & reprint it; the final model also has the labels a little less deep into the plastic. This was inspired by this pH rack on Thingiverse by NAbel https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3247407.

What I found with most of them is that they reduce the overall airflow and it causes an increase in fan noise with a high pitched whine. 

I decided that if I made an extension that fit the fan that was also vented, then I can still have a neat look and keep the fan quiet and efficient. 

This extension is 15mm tall. Mine is hot glued in place, though I did make holes for longer screws if desired. One file has a Empire style (think Death Star lighting) grating, the other is more open.

Please post your makes!

A simple tool to remove the bottom layer of resin when using the ""vat cleaning"" option on modern resin printers. 
1. Place the tool in the corner/s of your vat while resin is still in the vat. 
2. Perform the screen/FEP cleaning option on your printer. This will cure the bottom layer of resin in the vat with the tool.
3. After your printer has completed curing the bottom layer of resin, pull up on the tool to remove cured layer.
4. Use the cutouts and wedges on the underside of the top of the tool to hang on build plate to allow any resin to drip back into the vat. (some printers may require two tools in different corners to hang from build plate)

The tool is intended to be disposed of with the cured layer. This is a useful way to remove any hardened resin stuck to the FEP after a misprint. 
I use this with my Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra to keep from using a scraper or squidgy on my FEP.","Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/ff/f1/a1/db/90/vat_bed_cleaner_3_inch.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/92/3f/1f/b8/db/vat_bed_cleaner_V2.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/af/29/7a/5a/3e/vat_bed_cleaner.png""]","{""name"":""blu***nef***r"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/bluelinefever""}",[],"2024-11-28T00:00:50.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6848771/files",0,0,2,

With its sleek design and bold font, the ""Zero Hero"" sign is sure to catch the eye of anyone who sees it. But unlike other signs that serve a useful purpose, this one simply displays the number 0 in all its glory. It doesn't light up, it doesn't make noise, and it certainly doesn't do your taxes (although that would be pretty cool).

But don't let its lack of functionality fool you. The ""Zero Hero"" sign is a true work of art. It's made from the finest 3D printed plastic and features a sturdy base that will keep it upright for years to come. You can even use it as a paperweight or doorstop (although we're not sure why you would).

So if you're looking for a sign that's as useless as it is beautiful, look no further than the ""Zero Hero"" 3D printed sign. It's the perfect addition to any home, office, or art museum (okay, maybe not the last one). Who needs practicality when you can have a sign that proudly displays the number 0?","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/6e/b1/b1/14/a8/898040ed-c390-4528-a2c7-d3b794742ea9.png""]","{""name"":""aly***158***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/alynch1580""}","[""sign""]","2023-03-19T17:57:50.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/5919928/files",0,0,1,

It only took me about 8 hours to complete (I was staying up all night to get my Hunting License, and modeled this on a separate monitor while the page timers ran down for the license), and I'm happy with how it turned out. I planned on adding more detail to the thruster section and rounding the top area off to make it less boxy, but that fell through. All in all, I am very happy with how it turned out because I modeled it on OnShape. If you've ever used OnShape, you know how much of a pain that program can be, and I was still pretty new to the program. My ability with OnShape has much improved since then, but I decided I wanted to upload this model just to see what other people may do with it. Please, if you download the file, feel free to make changes or additions, and if you do, please post them as a remix or something where I can see them, because I would love to see!

Made with freecad on linux computer.
The purpose is to put a round bar from 10 mm or 3/8"" in the slot where the strings pass over.
This bridge gives very good sustain because of the solid construction and large surface contact with the lapsteel.
String spacing is 11 mm or a little more then 3/8"".

As you can see the bridge has a little intonation correction, where the lower strings will have a slightly longer scale.

I wanted to create a bridge where you can quickly remove the strings above the pickup to change the pickup designs, without complete unwind the the strings.

Mit der hier integrierten zusätzlichen Ablageschale entsteht im WoMo mehr nutzbare Fläche direkt neben den Tisch.
Das ganze System besteht aus 4 Bauteilen (BT), wobei BT1 und BT2 jeweils doppelt gedruckt werden muss. Beim Zusammenbau von links werden die Teile in dieser Reihenfolge zusammengesteckt (verklebt): BT2 BT2 BT4 BT3 BT1 BT1 - so wird die komplette offene Fuge in der Länge von 1,07m geschlossen

Als Variante stehen die schmalen Fensterbänke BT1 und BT2 mit bzw. ohne Lüftungslöcher zur Verfügung - je nachdem, ob eine Belüftung zwischen Außenwand und der Holzverkleidung benötigt wird oder es oben quasi luftdicht abschließen soll.

Das Design ist in einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von Mitgliedern der my-pepper.de Community entstanden - Danke dir lieber Werner :-)

Viel Spaß beim Nachdruck und der Verwendung


Update: auf besonderen Wunsch eine Variante, in der das BT1 ausgetauscht werden kann um so noch mehr Ablagefläche zu erhalten. Es steht BT1_Ablageschale mit und ohne Lüftungslöcher zur Verfügung.

I purchased the extensions that they sell for larger than 55 gallon tanks and they unfortunately did not work for my tank due to the rim width. So I created these custom extenders that work great. 

The suction cups I used are 8-9mm on the back, which squeezes into the 7.6mm cylinder opening/mounts, (the actual suction cup size is 1.5"")

Printing these as they are ended up fitting our 75 gallon aquarium snugly without any clamping device in place. The idea is the outer portion is flush up against the tank and then the inner portion is flush up against the glass ( see photo), but I included a hole for a screw to fit through in order to secure to side of tank if you have a different size or tank rim measurements.

I have been a fan for a while, and I'm really happy with the bunnies I've made so far! 

I have not edited the inside, so this head is compatible with dolllightful's bjd bunny, and i'm guessing it will fit Moonlight Jewel's remix as well, if its scaled properly.

1 x POWOXI 8A charge controller 
1 x Volt / Amp meter with shunt 
2 x ML 9-12 AGM Batteries 
1 x Switch 

Design considerations / features:
- The charger only activates when the panel is connected (doesn't drain the batteries)
- Solar panel can be connected from the outside via a DC jack (rain proof) 
- No load limit (you can pull up to 200 Amps from the two parallel batteries) 
- Compact in size and enough power to run whatever you want

The cipher ring from osj1961's design is a Caesar cipher. I made 2 more rings for Atbash and A1Z26 ciphers. I also included a blank cipher ring so you can add your own symbols or letter combination if you want.

With these rings (and the ring from the original design) you'll be able to decipher Caesar, Atbash and A1Z26 codes, or combinations of the 3 such as this one:

kR5; ry1 F25mK D10 iDXb 24J17N Osn 13 gR23Yo?

You can also use the Caesar cipher to decode Vigenère code like I was doing in the picture, although that takes a bit more patience.

I printed the rings on my QIDI Q1 Pro at 15% infill. Printing at a layer height of 0.1mm is recommended. No rafts or supports needed.

Beware, these pipes make the Infraction a lowrider and they will scrape the ground on bumps over five millimeters or so. Because of this, I would recommend only using them on smooth/pretty flat pavement. They fit tightly between the chassis side handles and the body shell wall, perfectly hiding the attachment mount and only showing the awesome thirteen-and-a-half-millimeter twin pipes underneath the car. To attach, first glue the two parts together, then simply just clip the side exhaust mounts around the chassis side handles. Hope everyone enjoys these awesome side exhaust pipes!


Update 1:
I have created a new V2 design of these side exhaust pipes that increases ride height and has four exhaust pipes instead of two. I have also updated both V1 (the original) and the new V2 to have a tighter fit on the chassis side handles (they were clipping on kind of loosely before).

Update 2:
I have gotten rid of the V2 exhaust pipes download because I realized they are way too small in diameter and aren't proportional to the Infraction's size. The V1.1 design is the only current available download as of now.","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/d2/40/5f/98/a8/8c1c2e7b-b21a-4b93-b60f-43bc8558470a.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/79/ef/fc/b5/68/92980f67-b603-4f61-89de-1684f81586df.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/35/bb/44/b7/b2/053a6e24-1a43-4558-94a5-a1e7114932c3.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/9f/6a/74/c4/28/1ee6e86c-5673-4482-92fa-bfdb5b3ad97b.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/cc/68/37/e1/0a/b39d168f-d4d7-4b72-ae06-526dd08e3f6b.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/dd/02/7e/4a/72/ef4dd301-5e30-4e5b-8e3b-ddae325f9521.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/23/c2/23/67/92/30d2ee2b-9252-425e-80b1-fca972cfaaab.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/70/e4/33/39/1b/78ba49af-447c-40e8-9999-5e29cc842f51.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/d8/9f/b7/0c/de/cbc59364-8fb6-4053-8e79-e18147ca8e5e.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/a3/f3/89/84/34/e09b02c4-f823-43ff-8af4-273933fc3667.png""]","{""name"":""J0u***yRo***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/J0urneyRocks""}",[],"2023-06-28T02:15:27.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6097403/files",0,6,4,"Printer brand: Prusa Printer: I3 MK3S Rafts: No Supports: No Resolution: 0.2mm Infill: 10% Filament brand: Solutech Filament color: Silver Filament material: PLA"

I glued cork to the bottom of the coasters and the TARDIS holds 11 coasters that can be removed without taking the top off, or 12 if you pick up the top.

Got a battery operated 10 LED light set at Dollar Tree.  Cut off the last 3, only used 7.
Glued the battery pack in with E6000.  Attached the lights with a hot glue gun.   for the top light I drilled a 3/16"" hole in the bottom of ""TARDIS_lamp_x175.stl""  and it holds the LED tight.

It was incredibly frustrating when I wanted to go to the gym right after classes and didn't want to carry a bulky gym bag. There must be a better way to have the convenience of two pairs of shoes without the hassle of carrying both.
That's where the idea of interchangeable soles for shoes came in. By designing a shoe with a removable and interchangeable sole, it would be possible to have one shoe that can be used for multiple activities. For example, you could wear the same shoe for running and weightlifting, simply by switching out the sole. This would reduce the need for multiple pairs of shoes and make it easier to travel to the gym or exercise outside. 
But the usefulness of the interchangeable sole shoe continues beyond just athletic activities. Another use case for this shoe would be for going out to events where different types of footwear are needed. For example, a woman may want to wear high heels to a formal event, but later on, she may want to dance comfortably in flats at a club or party. With an interchangeable sole shoe, she could simply remove the heel sole and replace it with a flat sole, allowing her to dance comfortably without sacrificing style.
Innovative footwear designs like this can improve people's lives by providing convenience and versatility. It can also reduce the need for multiple pairs of shoes, which is better for the environment and wallet. Overall, the idea of interchangeable sole shoes has the potential to revolutionize the footwear industry and make people's lives easier and more sustainable.

 “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants”

I present you a modification to Uppercut that can fire a ""fire"" cap rounds.

I made it with as little changes and new parts as I could.

This is not a easy mod!! it takes some screws and a sawed off nail!!

Assembly:

Walker Base has a new hole now that houses a sping that connects to new Hammer
(Maybe not needed see for your self)


Walker Hammer has a new hole too! there you will have to glue in a sawed off nail.

Bullet now screws in together. The lower part now houses a screw that will hold the cap. You will have to play a bit with the screw to place it just right so that the cap doesnt prevent you cycling.

Roll out the dough on the pan with at least a 2 cm border larger than the cookie cutter.

You need to press this into the dough on the pan and bake it as one big sheet of dough. Don't separate the pieces until <b>after</b> it's baked.

I used PLA so I wouldn't dare press it into hot cookie dough on a hot pan, but in theory with the right material you'd press this into the cookie as soon as it comes out of the oven to re-cut the lines where they baked together.

When using the customizer to develop complex models, it is often difficult to visually determine the correspondence of parameters and dimensions of the model.

I use color highlighting.

Color the entire element if it is clearly understandable. For example, a cylinder - height and width. 

During the ""difference"" operation, the hole will be colored in the selected color.

If the size is difficult to clearly determine, for example, width and thickness, use an additional element with the ""%"" modifier.

You can see examples of coloring in the customizer.

You can also display the names of the parameters and their values ​​in text in the form of a table.

You can also see an example in the customizer.","Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/8c/5f/d1/25/fc/c-1.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/dc/0f/15/3b/49/c-2.jpg"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/e6/48/93/4b/d9/coloring.png""]","{""name"":""Kus***ren***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/Kushnirenko""}","[""customized"",""customizer"",""openscad"",""openscadtutorial""]","2024-10-31T08:00:07.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6814948/files",0,2,2,

I started a project to make 28mm miniatures that would print without supports quickly. These minis print flat in 2 pieces and then I glue them together with a little bit of super glue. Now I can make custom minis that print quickly on FDM, don't need paint, and are friendly with wet erase. Hopefully they can be of use to you as well.

This mini comes in 1 size.

Print without any support. In order to install it put two IKEA Scadis pegboards on the floor, take the longer connector part and put it underneath peg-boards. Then slowly apply pressure until it fit into the board. Then close it from another side with a second connector piece. The connection is pretty tight so might want to use a mallet or a piece of wood to close two parts together. Be careful while moving the boards until you install all the connectors because 2-3 connectors will not sustain the weight of the boards and might break.","Creative Commons - Attribution","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/f1/b5/8d/25/a6/371098e0-fb82-4e46-91d7-0014dc8f8c5b.png""]","{""name"":""Lor***koo***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/LordRakoon""}","[""IKEA Skadis"",""skadis""]","2023-12-12T14:39:32.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6370702/files",0,11,1,

In meinem kleinen Schützenverein ist es Pflicht die Hülsen nach dem Schießen zu entfernen ... und 50 kleine Messingzylinder zusammen zu sammeln macht keinen Spaß. Daher dieser Hülsenfänger für das Ruger Precision Rimfire Gewehr (.22lr). 

Gedruckt mit 0,2mm Schichthöhe und 30% Infill aus PLA. Ein Brim ist bei der gegebenen Teilfläche nicht schlecht.

Zusätzlich: Zwei M5x8mm Schrauben und zwei M5 T-Muttern und eine leere Mentos Kaugummi 100St. Packung - ja ich mag Kaugummi ;) 


In my little shootingclub you are obligated to collect your brass after session. So I designed this rig to help me with it. It is made for the Ruger Precision Rimfire Rifle in .22lr.

Printed in 0.2mm Layer hight with 30% Infill from PLA. A Brim is adviced.

Aditionally: Two M5x8mm Bolts and two M5 T-Nuts and an empty Mentos Gum 100 pices pack - Yes I like gum ;)

The bubble grip handle is a press fit and will not come off easily once you get it in place. I used vice grips and a hammer just to get it in place. This resulted in minor marring of the surface which I hid with modpodge and paint.

The entire boxcutter while can be used by both right and left handed people but was designed for a left handed user and can be opened with one hand. 

NOTE: the operation of this knife is easier in the left hand. If done with just the right hand it requires a good bit of dexterity. If you want a right hand use knife flip the model in your slicer of choice. 

Assembly:
- Print all three parts separate on their flat sides
- place blade into blade follower aligning the notches (this prevents slipping)
- place blade follower into side A such that the lever is sticking out of the frame
- slide both pieces into the dovetails of side B
- depress the back catch mechanism before sliding over the matching hole and clicking into place

To operate:
- move the top latch to the right and slide the blade forward before clicking it into place,
- to close, do the same in reverse.","Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike","[""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/05/67/59/b5/c6/knife_cover_image.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/bb/21/d4/fd/3b/Knife_closed.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/64/b4/35/fd/3e/Knife_open.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/48/ad/b0/8b/8d/knife_field_strip.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/21/b7/87/c0/40/7c59722d-1e74-4fec-8582-07440b37f312.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/22/44/93/03/d4/a6957156-aa66-4cad-90d7-919e4272aa96.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/1a/b1/d4/64/24/01c19b3d-0557-455a-992d-a16a1d8a5536.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/a4/ea/a2/26/94/a51e704b-744e-4107-8adc-36e3dd3a7100.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/eb/9b/82/e6/de/bebc956b-d8e4-49eb-90e0-95fa83f91818.png"",""https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/cb/a9/de/46/3f/3dc627e6-4580-43d2-92d1-4ff3c5816690.png""]","{""name"":""Wil***oth***"",""url"":""https://www.thingiverse.com/WildSlothMan""}","[""blade"",""box cutter"",""knife""]","2024-08-26T00:44:32.000Z","https://api.thingiverse.com/things/6743630/files",0,2,3,

You can see how it was designed and built in my YouTube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMqapZTaqv8

You will need:
- 1 Arduino
-1 9G servo
-A small piece of wire to drive the flag from the servo
-A 2.25"" wide roll of cash register paper (Preferably paper you can write on. The waxy ink stuff doesn't work well for that)
-1 Stepper motor
-1 Stepper motor controller
- A couple small springs from the hardware store
- 3/16 metal round bar for the unpowered roller
- 2 5X8X2.5mm bearings. This is what I bought since I use small bearings a lot.

I used an existing design for the actual mailbox, and I designed all the parts that go inside. I did scale all the parts from the original designer up 125%.

I started a project to make 28mm miniatures that would print without supports quickly. These minis print flat in 2 pieces and then I glue them together with a little bit of super glue. Now I can make custom minis that print quickly on FDM, don't need paint, and are friendly with wet erase. Hopefully they can be of use to you as well.

A typical D20 has the numbers arranged so that sum of the two faces opposite each other will add up to 21. On a spin down dice, the numbers are placed next to each other so it's easier to reposition in order to keep track of your life total in MTG. 

This dice is 151 mm tall as modeled so scale your print accordingly.
